# Hey 👀

I'm Joe, a software developer currently focused on Javascript, Typescript, DevOps and Entrepreneurship.

✍ Some phrases I like 📒
- Programming experience doesn't mean you don't create bugs, it means you recognize them quickly.
- Nothing in this world beats persistence and determination.
- First, recognize the problem, then solve the problem, and finally, create the best solution of all.
