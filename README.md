# Hey 👀

I'm Joe, a software developer currently focused on Javascript, Typescript, DevOps and Entrepreneurship.

✍ Some phrases I like 📒

Programming experience doesn't mean you don't create bugs, it means you recognize them quickly.

Nothing in this world beats persistence and determination.

First, recognize the problem, then solve the problem, and finally, create the best solution of all.
